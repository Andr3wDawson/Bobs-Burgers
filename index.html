The series centers on the Belcher family—parents Bob and Linda and their three children, Tina, Gene, and Louise—who run a hamburger restaurant and often go on adventures of many kinds. The show was conceived by Bouchard after he developed Home Movies. Bob's Burgers is a production by Bento Box Entertainment and 20th Television Animation.</p>

            <p class="about__para">Bob Belcher (H. Jon Benjamin) is the titular protagonist of the show and owner of "Bob's Burgers". He is the husband to Linda and father to Tina, Gene, and Louise. He is a second generation restaurateur and is 44 years old. Bob was born to an unnamed mother and Big Bob, who ran a diner called "Big Bob's Diner". Bob had a relatively unhappy childhood as his mother died when he was young and his father was an alcoholic who forced Bob to constantly work. His father is also known to never smile, and holds resentment for Bob leaving and starting his own business. Bob is the more sensible one of his family, though he is not afraid to get petty and is often stubborn and exasperated. Despite his somewhat pessimistic personality, he loves and cares for his family, as well as for his restaurant and Burgers of the Day. Like the rest of his family, Bob has black hair, tanned skin, and dark eyes. He is a fan of foreign films.</p>
